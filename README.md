# Big-Factorial

A java program that uses multi-threading to compute large integer factorials.

> There is no approximation and the output value is accurate.

> It utilizes BigInteger, which requires the import of java.math.BigInteger

> Only non-negative integers (BigInteger) should be given as inputs.

> Program will break and enter infinite loop if negative number is inputted.

> Program will return the value in BigInteger data type.

Factorial_Initialize class is just to give an example on how to use the BigFactorial class.
